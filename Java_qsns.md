# 🚫 Why Java Doesn’t Support Operator Overloading

## 1️⃣ To Keep Code Simple and Readable
In languages like **C++**, the `+` operator could mean:
- Adding numbers
- Merging strings
- Or even something unusual like combining two files — depending on the programmer's implementation.

Java’s designers wanted **operators to have one clear meaning** so that:
- Code remains **predictable**.
- Anyone reading the code instantly understands what it does without guessing.

## 2️⃣ To Avoid Complexity and Misuse
Operator overloading can lead to:
- Confusing and unpredictable behavior.
- **Hard-to-debug** issues when developers misuse it.
- Increased learning curve for new developers.

---

✅ **Conclusion**: By avoiding operator overloading, Java keeps code **simple, readable, and less error-prone**.
